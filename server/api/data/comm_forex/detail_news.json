                    "Gold falls in early Asian trade but remains above $4,500/oz. Prices are likely to continue being elevated by safe-haven demand as intensifying geopolitical tensions continue, and expectations of a more accommodative U.S. monetary policy, Daniel Takieddine of Sky Links Capital Group writes in a note. The possibility of a more dovish Fed leadership after Jerome Powell's term ends could serve as a tailwind for gold, Takieddine adds. Spot gold is 0.5% lower at $4,508.03/oz. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)"
